                <p class="center">Ingredients:

                    1 liter full-fat milk
                    1/2 cup sugar
                    1/4 cup chopped nuts (such as almonds, pistachios, or cashews)
                    1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
                    2 tablespoons condensed milk
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Instructions:
                    <br>
                    1.In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to low and let the milk simmer, stirring occasionally, for about an hour or until it has reduced to half its original volume.
                    <br>
                    2.Add the sugar, chopped nuts, and cardamom powder to the milk, and stir well.

                    4.Add the condensed milk to the mixture and stir well. This will give the kulfi a creamy texture.

                    5.Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then pour it into kulfi molds or small cups.

                    6.Freeze the kulfi for at least 6 hours or overnight until it is completely frozen.

                    7.To serve, remove the kulfi from the molds or cups and garnish with additional chopped nuts, if desired.

                    <br>
                    For the Masala:
                    3 boiled and mashed potatoes
                    1/2 chopped onion
